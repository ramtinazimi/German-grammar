# German-grammar
This is summary of all grammatical rules consisting in the German language.

This report was done during my work as a German teacher at Colegio Arenas Internacional on Lanzarote.
It was aimed for Spanish students who were being taught the German language.
The language used to explain the Grammar is English. Thus, the grammar is entirely written in English.

At times, we will make crossrefernces to the Spanish grammar in order to elaborate grammatical structures.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.
