# German_grammar
This is summary of all grammatical rules consisting in the German language.

This work was done during my teaching year at Colegio Arenas Internacional in Lanzarote.
It was aimed for Spanish students who were being taught the German language.
The language used to explain the Grammar is English. Thus, the grammar is entirely written in English.

At times, we will make crossrefernces to the Spanish grammar in order to elaborate ideas.

If you have any wqquestions, feel free to message me.
